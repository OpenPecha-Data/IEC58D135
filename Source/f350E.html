	<h2>A Garland of Vajra Gems</h2>
<h3>The Life and Liberation of the Guru</h3>
<p><strong><em>by JamgÃ¶n Kongtrul</em></strong> </p>
<h4>1. The Birth and Reign of the Guru in the Land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna</h4>
<p>Emaho!<br/>
From the vast and boundless field of simplicity,<br/>
in the palace of the Lotus Array of Great Bliss,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
AmitÄbha, Buddha of Boundless Light, Sovereign of the Three KÄyas,<br/>
resolves to tame the barbaric beings of saá¹sÄra,<br/>
to eliminate the wrong views of the tÄ«rthikas,<br/>
and to light the torch of the genuine Dharma â<br/>
by sending a buddha emanation supreme.<br/>
Not someone of mere womb-birth but only one born miraculously<br/>
Would be able to tame gods, demons, and humans.<br/>
Thus, by magnetizing and wrathful means,<br/>
from the wisdom maá¹á¸ala of the vajra-mind<br/>
the Lotus Lord emanates as the syllable <em>hrÄ«á¸¥</em>. </p>
<p>On an isle in the pristine KoÅa Sea,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> with its eight-fold qualities,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a><br/>
on the anthers of an untouched budding lotus he was born.<br/>
The flower itself, the size of a chariotâs wheel,<br/>
gleamed with light and brilliance<br/>
as the morning sun shone down.<br/>
So beautiful, its adornment of the waters! Perfect grace!<br/>
At night, rainbows swirled across the boundless surface.<br/>
Every other flower must yearly change from new to old,<br/>
yet the uá¸umbara stalk that rose at the waterâs centre<br/>
never met growth or decline, neither summer nor winter.<br/>
Instead, with its petals always closed, it brought amazement to all.<br/>
At this sight, the kingâs messengers reported what theyâd found.<br/>
Ministers were consulted, a sentry was dispatched,<br/>
and there, never resting, he watched the flower, day and night.<br/>
Then, on the tenth day of the monkey month, in the monkey year,<br/>
the lotus petals opened.<br/>
There, upon the anthers at the centre,<br/>
sat a beautiful child, enchanting to behold.<br/>
Rainbows shone, flowers rained from the skies,<br/>
lightning roared and crackled, the earth shook and rumbled â good omens all.<br/>
From the south came the great king, bringing his retinue,<br/>
disbelieving still, right up to the waterâs edge â<br/>
where he saw the beautiful infant child sparkling with dew.<br/>
In awe he prostrated before him and his voice rose in praise:<br/>
âThis blessed childâ, he sang, âour prince shall he be!â </p>
<p>He set sail across the water, to try to reach him,<br/>
but without success was forced to retreat.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>
<p>Uá¸á¸iyÄnaâs King DhanapÄla<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> had no royal son,<br/>
And had made donations over the years, giving away many fine things,<br/>
until, over time, the royal vaults ran dry.<br/>
In hopes of finding treasure, he had set out to sea<br/>
and, returning, he saw the boy, exactly as described.<br/>
âThis, my destined son!â he said,<br/>
and boarded the ship, fetching child and lotus both.<br/>
At the palace they enthroned the boy and offered him the crown.<br/>
The king made supplication to this wish-bestowing jewel,<br/>
and the wealth of the kingdom was once again restored.<br/>
The prince reigned for five years, in harmony with the Dharma,<br/>
guarding the welfare of his kingdom. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: the Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the first chapter: The Birth and Reign of the Guru in the Land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna. </p>
<h4>2. The Guru Abandons the Empire and Dwells in the ÅÄ«tavana Charnel Ground</h4>
<p>One day, the Guru was resting in realization<br/>
when he saw the face of Vajrasattva and received his prophecy:<br/>
âHow, governing a kingdom, will you benefit beings?<br/>
Rather, through power, reason, and action you will tame them!â<br/>
The Guru decided to act in accordance with this<br/>
and considered just how he might abandon the throne.<br/>
âIf I publicly practice the yoga of uncontrived conduct,<br/>
it will displease the king and ministers and could be my chance for escape.â<br/>
Thus, he started deliberately some unconventional yogic practices,<br/>
and indeed most of the evil-minded ministers became upset.<br/>
Confiding, they sought counsel before their king:<br/>
âThe young prince is doing all kinds of odd things.<br/>
He should be exiled from the state for such behaviour.<br/>
This very day he must be driven out, far away from here.â<br/>
Despite the kingâs protesting, they would not be swayed,<br/>
so they banished him to India, the ÅÄ«tavana charnel ground.<br/>
There, he subjugated the mÄtá¹kÄs and á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
enjoining them in the four unions, and liberating the vicious.<br/>
He spent five years with the á¸ÄkinÄ«s, turning the wheel of Dharma,<br/>
and at last, while practicing the deities of Amá¹taâs Qualities,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a><br/>
he attained accomplishment, had visions of the deities,<br/>
and received their prophecy.<br/>
He became known as Padmasambhava the Master of Qualities. </p>
<p>From the <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: the Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the second chapter: the Guru Abandons the Empire and Dwells in the ÅÄ«tavana Charnel Ground. </p>
<h4>3. The Guruâs Visions of the Deities and Attainment of Accomplishments</h4>
<p>Next, he took to the Great HÅ«á¹ Cave,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a><br/>
with the intention to attain the great VidyÄdharaâs wisdom mind.<br/>
There he trained in the deities of ÅrÄ« Heruka,<br/>
slaying the male demons and joining with the females.<br/>
Perfecting yogic conduct, he spent five years there,<br/>
turning the wheel of Dharma amongst the á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<br/>
He had visions of the deities of ÅrÄ« Heruka<br/>
and in a single instant attained both the supreme and common siddhis.<br/>
He became known as <em>Padmasambhava the Mighty Master</em>. </p>
<p>Then, he took to the charnel ground Terrifying Grove,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a><br/>
where he practiced the deities of YamÄntaka.<br/>
Donning the eight ornaments of the charnel ground,<br/>
and magnetizing the á¸ÄkinÄ«s, he presided as the great gaá¹acakra chief.<br/>
Perfecting union and liberation, he attained the supreme siddhi.<br/>
Gazing upon the face of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«-YamÄntaka,<br/>
he attained accomplishment in the twelve fierce activities.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a><br/>
Five years he spent there, his back against the stÅ«pa,<br/>
becoming known as <em>Padmasambhava the Wise Master</em>. </p>
<p>Then, he took to the charnel ground Lotus Mound,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a><br/>
where he practiced the magnetizing deities of Mighty Padma-HayagrÄ«va,<br/>
engaging in the awakened activities of union and liberation<br/>
and turning for the á¸ÄkinÄ«s the Dharma wheel of secret mantra.<br/>
He had visions of the deities of Mighty Padma<br/>
and attained the supreme power of the great VidyÄdharaâs wisdom speech.<br/>
He became known as <em>Padma HayagrÄ«va Sambhava, the Lotus-Born, the Horse-Headed Master</em>.<br/>
and stayed for five years, accomplishing the immeasurable benefit of beings beyond number. </p>
<p>Then, he took to the charnel ground Zombie Grove,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
where he practiced the deities of KÄ«laâs Activity.<br/>
He magnetized every mÄtá¹kÄ and á¸ÄkinÄ« there,<br/>
performing union, liberation, and empowerment,<br/>
and turning the Dharma wheel of secret mantra.<br/>
He had visions of the deities of VajrakumÄra<br/>
and attained the power to smash the obstructing hordes of mÄras.<br/>
There he stayed for five years, seven months, and ten days,<br/>
And was known as <em>Padmasambhava the Master of Activity</em>. </p>
<p>From the <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: the Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the third chapter: the Guruâs Visions of the Deities and Attainment of Accomplishments.</p>
<h4>4. The Guru Practices in the Eight Charnel Grounds, Perfecting the Unconfined Yogic Conduct of Liberation and Union</h4>
<p>Then the Guru left for the charnel ground Spontaneous Mound,<br/>
to practice the maá¹á¸ala of MÄtryÄvahanavisarjana, Calling and Dispatching MÄtá¹kÄs.<br/>
There he ate human flesh and wore human hides.<br/>
He liberated the male demons and united with the females,<br/>
turning the wheel of Dharma amongst the á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<br/>
He had visions of the MÄtryÄvahanavisarjana deities<br/>
and received the infinite empowerments of supreme and common activity.<br/>
He spent five years there, perfecting yogic discipline,<br/>
And was known as <em>Padmasambhava the Master Sorcerer</em>. </p>
<p>Then he took to the charnel ground All-Pervading Utter Joy,<br/>
to practice LokapÅ«jÄstrota, Offering and Praising Worldly Deities.<br/>
He magnetized the arrogant spirits of father, mother, and neuter lineages;<br/>
he magnetized á¸ÄkinÄ«s and the eight classes of gods and demons,<br/>
and he appointed them as attendants to accomplish the four activities.<br/>
At the Guruâs command they pledged allegiance,<br/>
and he poured on their tongues the secret samaya substances.<br/>
He became sovereign chieftain over all worldly spirits,<br/>
liberating the five poisons and uniting with the expanse of the five kÄyas.<br/>
He had visions of the LokapÅ«jÄstrota maá¹á¸ala and attained accomplishment.<br/>
For five years, five months, and five days he remained,<br/>
famed as <em>Padmasambhava the Master of Offering and Praise</em>. </p>
<p>Then he took to the charnel ground Loka Mound,<br/>
to tame without exception<br/>
the many malicious demons there who harbored evil wishes.<br/>
He practiced the vanquishing SÄdhana of Fierce Mantras,<br/>
and, opening the MantrabhÄ«ru maá¹á¸ala,<br/>
he remained in the samÄdhi known as âDestructive Curseâ.<br/>
Thus, alike for every foreboding spirit and demon,<br/>
he performed the activity of subduing, incinerating, and casting.<br/>
Bearing down in conquest, he liberated the male demons<br/>
and united with the females, magnetizing them all,<br/>
and he turned to dust all those with wrong view.<br/>
With visions of the deities of black MahÄbala,<br/>
he attained the empowerment and accomplishment of liberating enemies of the teachings.<br/>
And for five years, nine months, and nine days did he remain,<br/>
Becoming known as <em>Padmasambhava the Master of Wrath and Allure</em>. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: the Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the fourth chapter: the Guru Practices in the Eight Charnel Grounds, Perfecting the Unconfined Yogic Conduct of Liberation and Union.</p>
<h4>5. The Guru Establishes the Dharma in the Kingdom of Zahor and Accomplishes the Level of the MahÄmudrÄ VidyÄdhara</h4>
<p>The Guru PadmÄkara then decided to go to India,<br/>
and turn throughout its lands the wheel of the sublime Dharma.<br/>
âI shall teach the genuine Dharma to all,â was his thought,<br/>
but they asked, âWho is your guru?â<br/>
He replied, âI am the self-arisen guide, a buddha.<br/>
Despite not having a guru, I know the genuine Dharma.â<br/>
âThere is no self-arisen guideâ, they said, âsave for ÅÄkyamuni.â<br/>
âWhat you sayâ, he replied, âis none other than mÄra,<br/>
and so I flatly refuse to listen.â </p>
<p>Without a guru, however, he was unable to benefit others,<br/>
and so he decided to attend several qualified masters,<br/>
accomplished scholars of India such as<br/>
MaÃ±juÅrÄ«mitra, ÅrÄ« Siá¹ha, and Vimalamitra.<br/>
Of the many scholars and siddhas whom he met,<br/>
he actually attended one hundred and eight.<br/>
Training in the outer, inner, and secret dharmas of sÅ«tra and mantra,<br/>
he made his main focus the secret mantra practices of the Great Perfection<br/>
and the subtle-body methods of inner heat and empty-bliss as the path.<br/>
Meanwhile, he did he not neglect the five sciences, but gained proficiency in them.<br/>
Merely introduced to any teaching, he immediately understood. </p>
<p>He then took to Zahor, in pursuit of study and practice.<br/>
The king of this region was ArÅadhara,<br/>
an extremely wealthy sovereign, with empress, ministers, and many subjects.<br/>
He had only one child, a daughter, Princess MandÄravÄ.<br/>
Like a child of the gods, with every mark of excellence,<br/>
unmatched by any other, and arrestingly beautiful.<br/>
Throughout the lands of India, of China, Turkistan, and Kashmir,<br/>
the kings of Uá¸á¸iyÄna and Nepal, Persia and Mongolia<br/>
ardently competed for her hand.<br/>
But she accepted no-one, remaining untarnished by saá¹sÄra.<br/>
To practice the sublime dharma, she cloistered herself within the palace.<br/>
The Guru saw her to be a secret disciple of empty-bliss,<br/>
and turned for her the Dharma wheel of the four joys â great bliss-wisdom.<br/>
As they remained within the perfection of blissful comfort,<br/>
a wandering herdsman discovered them<br/>
and reported what he had seen to the ministers and royal servants.<br/>
Word spread throughout the palace, making it known to all.<br/>
When it came to the kingâs attention, he fumed with rage, commanding:<br/>
âThis renunciant is to be sentenced to death by fire,<br/>
and she with her servants shall be cast into prison!<br/>
This could be dangerous! If word gets out,<br/>
the surrounding kingdoms will rise as enemies against us.<br/>
No one may see them! They must be punished!â<br/>
The ministers conferred and decreed twenty main punishments.<br/>
The Guru refrained from displaying miracles,<br/>
pretending to be an ordinary person.<br/>
Thus he was captured by the kingâs men.<br/>
Oil was poured on the pyre to create a fierce blaze<br/>
that would burn the Guruâs bound body.<br/>
With that, they departed back to their homes.<br/>
The imprisoned princess and her servants<br/>
were cast into a pit of thorns, where they suffered miserably.<br/>
After seven days, the king demanded<br/>
that the charred skull of the foreign monk be brought to him.<br/>
Envoys were dispatched, and saw as they arrived<br/>
that the smoke had dispersed, but the fire still blazed high.<br/>
In the centre was a swirling lake and a blossoming lotus flower.<br/>
Seated atop its stamen was the precious Guru,<br/>
now an eight-year-old child, youthful and vibrant.<br/>
Amazed, the messengers fell prostrate before him,<br/>
and quickly returned to inform the king.<br/>
Unable to believe it, with his queen, ministers, and subjects,<br/>
he went to see for himself.<br/>
Finding the Guru as described, all alike felt remorse<br/>
â king, ministers, queen, and the people at large.<br/>
Confessing and begging forgiveness, they bowed at his feet.<br/>
They invited him to the palace and asked him to turn the wheel of Dharma,<br/>
and MandÄravÄ was presented as his constant companion.<br/>
The entire kingdom of Zahor was thus established in the Dharma<br/>
and the Guru gained mastery in the secret mantra of union and liberation. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the fifth chapter: the Guru Establishes the Dharma in the Kingdom of Zahor and Accomplishes the Level of the MahÄmudrÄ VidyÄdhara. </p>
<h4>6. The Guruâs Travels to Tibet and the Completion of SamyÃ©</h4>
<p>The Guru PadmÄkara with his consort<br/>
established the Dharma in every region of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
Then, in Bodh Gaya, he tamed all the tÄ«rthikas;<br/>
he displayed miracles in VaiÅÄlÄ«,<br/>
and further established the genuine Dharma<br/>
throughout Kashmir, Khotan, and Mongolia. </p>
<p>Next, is the story of his journey to Tibet.<br/>
King Trisong Detsen, an emanation of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«,<br/>
had been examining the histories of his father and grandfather.<br/>
Deciding that the emperors of the last three generations<br/>
had merely upheld the tradition of the sacred Dharma,<br/>
his thought was that he âmust actually seek it!â<br/>
Meeting with his trusted Tibetan ministers,<br/>
he resolved to build SamyÃ© as the foundation for the teachings.<br/>
But malicious spirits with their magical powers<br/>
destroyed at night whatever the workers had constructed by day,<br/>
hurling back down all the earths, rocks, and timbers.<br/>
The ministers reported their failure to the king,<br/>
yet he forbade such an outcome, saying,<br/>
âIâll not die with this unfinished,<br/>
or else this life will have been utterly pointless!<br/>
There are many learned siddhas living in India,<br/>
and I will invite one to come and tame the land.â </p>
<p>He dispatched to India a swift-footed messenger<br/>
to invite the great Abbot Bodhisattva to come to Tibet.<br/>
On his arrival, he performed a ritual to tame the land<br/>
but was unable to subdue the wickedness by peaceful means.<br/>
He then told the emperor of a prophecy:<br/>
âThis savage land of Tibet is filled with demons.<br/>
Here the eight classes of arrogant spirits are incredibly strong.<br/>
There is no way anyone of womb-birth can tame them by peaceful means.<br/>
Invite PadmÄkara, the miraculously born!<br/>
He will tame this land and fulfil the emperorâs wishes,<br/>
for none but he can do this kind of taming.â </p>
<p>Following this advice, a messenger was sent.<br/>
And so, to benefit beings, the great master began his journey to Tibet.<br/>
On the way, he established the Dharma in all of Nepal.<br/>
He magnetized the hordes of the eight arrogant spirits,<br/>
particularly the three demons â<br/>
Lokmatrin of the ethereal realms,<br/>
the yaká¹£a GÃ¶makha and the nÄga Gyongpo.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a><br/>
He bound them under command and oath to strictly keep their pledge.<br/>
He hid countless treasures throughout the land of Nepal,<br/>
and gradually proceeded to Tibet.<br/>
He bound under oath the upper classes of gods and demons,<br/>
posting them henceforth as treasure guardians.<br/>
He then arrived at SamyÃ© where he met the emperor and tamed the land,<br/>
incapacitating gods and demons so that none could cause harm.<br/>
A three-storied temple was constructed<br/>
in the style of the Copper-Coloured Mountain,<br/>
complete with the four continents, four subcontinents, and a ring of iron mountains.<br/>
During the day it was humans building, and at night it was gods and demons. </p>
<p>In the year of the tiger, the foundation was set,<br/>
and it was completed in year of the male water horse.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a><br/>
Thus the wishes of the emperor, ministers, and retinue were accomplished. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the sixth chapter: the Guruâs Travels to Tibet and the Completion of SamyÃ©.</p>
<h4>7. The Blazing Beacon of the Dharma Dispels the Darkness of Tibet</h4>
<p>The heart-wish of Trisong Detsen had been fulfilled<br/>
with the building of the great outer temple.<br/>
Yet, still supports of enlightened Body, Speech, and Mind were needed,<br/>
and he resolved to commission abbot and master to build them.<br/>
According to the Guruâs guidance, the supports of body and mind were duly constructed.<br/>
Then the king requested that the support of enlightened speech,<br/>
the sacred Dharma, be translated into Tibetan.<br/>
Three translators, led by Vairocana, were chosen as students for the task.<br/>
They learned the art of translation and expressed the meaning accordingly.<br/>
Moreover, many children were gathered to study translation,<br/>
and were later sent to India to translate great tracts of the sublime Dharma.<br/>
The false views of the heretics faded and the genuine Dharma was established.<br/>
The unity of sÅ«tra and mantra, the great vehicle, spread far and wide.<br/>
Led by Vimalamitra, the great Kashmiri scholar,<br/>
many mahÄsiddhas, scholars, and translators were invited<br/>
to translate the words of the Buddha, complete and unabridged,<br/>
along with their commentaries, all brought from India.<br/>
The teachings of sÅ«tra and mantra, the doctrine of PadmÄkara,<br/>
Like the rising sun, began to spread throughout Tibet. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the seventh chapter: the Blazing Beacon of the Dharma Dispels the Darkness of Tibet.</p>
<h4>8. The Guru Hides Treasures in Tibet and Fulfills the Heart Wishes of the Emperor</h4>
<p>Now, with his heart wish completely accomplished,<br/>
Emperor Trisong Detsen held countless feasts and celebrations.<br/>
Substantial material offerings were made to the many translators<br/>
as they were gradually escorted back to their homelands.<br/>
Meanwhile the abbot Bodhisattva and PadmÄkara<br/>
remained, as requested, in the land of Tibet.<br/>
The great master made his way to SamyÃ© Chimpu,<br/>
While the learned ÅÄntaraká¹£ita settled in the upper floor of the temple.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> </p>
<p>One day, the emperor fell ill.<br/>
Hearing the news, the master left for the Yamalung cave<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
where he practiced the Protector AmitÄyus.<br/>
On the twenty-first day, in a vision, he saw the maá¹á¸ala of the Immortal Protector.<br/>
He requested, âGrant the emperor the empowerment of longevity!â<br/>
When the emperor arrived, however, his ministers, in their profanity,<br/>
created obstacles which stopped him from receiving the empowerment,<br/>
and so the opportunity passed.<br/>
At this, the master, to ensure their safety,<br/>
hid the longevity substances and maá¹á¸ala articles at Yamalung.<br/>
With the ministers unaware of what he was doing,<br/>
the emperor mounted the best of steeds and rode to meet the Guru.<br/>
He requested empowerment, but the Guru replied,<br/>
âNow is not the time, there are no empowerment substances.<br/>
I have hidden the maá¹á¸ala articles as a treasure.â<br/>
Devastated, the emperor again requested empowerment.<br/>
The master took from their hiding place the longevity substances<br/>
and, whilst bestowing the empowerment, he said:<br/>
âIf you had not been late last time and had received the empowerment,<br/>
you, Emperor, would have accomplished deathless vajra life.<br/>
However, your evil-minded ministers prevented this from happening.<br/>
Nevertheless, due to the strength of your past aspirations<br/>
and your unstinting wish to receive empowerment,<br/>
thirteen human years will be added to your life.â<br/>
He again hid the maá¹á¸ala and longevity substances as a treasure.<br/>
He traveled further on, throughout the provinces of Tibet,<br/>
blessing one hundred and eight sites of practice.<br/>
He placed in hiding countless precious and profound Dharma treasures<br/>
to bring ever-increasing benefit to beings. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the eighth chapter: the Guru Hides Treasures in Tibet and Fulfills the Heart Wishes of the Emperor. </p>
<h4>9. The Guru Perfects the Benefit of Beings in Tibet, and Sets Out for Other Lands</h4>
<p>Then, one day, the emperor gathered together<br/>
all the translators, headed by the master and abbot,<br/>
to practice <em>The Ocean of Dharma, Great Gathering of Transmitted Precepts</em>.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
Afterwards, they enjoyed extensive festivities.<br/>
The time then arrived for Tibetan New Year,<br/>
but the Master said not to celebrate.<br/>
The ministers and empress discussed amongst themselves:<br/>
âSave for having a good time, whatâs the harm in celebrating?<br/>
It just doesnât make sense to hold back!<br/>
Weâll have a word in private with the emperor.â<br/>
And, the celebrations went ahead.<br/>
In the hills, to the right of SamyÃ© lake,<br/>
there were to be horse races and archery competitions.<br/>
The master said not to take part in the horse race,<br/>
but the ministers didnât listen, resolving to go ahead with the races.<br/>
The minister Lhazang Lupel, who favoured the BÃ¶n religion,<br/>
Was full of scorn for the Dharma, and jealous of the king.<br/>
He fired an arrow from the crowd while the emperor was riding.<br/>
It pierced the emperorâs ribs and killed him outright.<br/>
Although everyone saw what happened, it was said that a tree root was to blame.<br/>
There was no investigation, and it was simply deemed the emperorâs time. </p>
<p>However, with Mutri Tsenpoâs ascent to the throne<br/>
his fatherâs legacy would not fall into decline.<br/>
The great master Padmasambhava, to benefit future beings,<br/>
travelled throughout Tibet, leaving no place untouched â neither border nor centre â<br/>
blessing places for practice and hiding many profound treasures.<br/>
At the borders and in the heartlands, he built genuine temples<br/>
and a hundred and eight stÅ«pas for subjugating mÄras.<br/>
At the summit of SamyÃ© Hepori Mountain,<br/>
together with Mutri Tsenpo and hundreds of assembled subjects,<br/>
Guru Padma made gaá¹acakra offerings â one hundred and eight in total.<br/>
Gathering in their entirety all malicious non-human and arrogant spirits,<br/>
he bound them under oath and assigned them their commitments,<br/>
whereupon they offered their life essence.<br/>
Actually present in person, the Guru perfected his disciples in Tibet. </p>
<p>It was then that the Guru decided<br/>
that it was time to tame the rÄká¹£asas.<br/>
With Mutri Tsenpo before him, the Guru spoke:<br/>
âSon, from the time you were small<br/>
you have been my blessing, the core of my heart.<br/>
Now, cleared of the suffering of your fatherâs passing,<br/>
you will bring happiness to this nation and spread the teachings of the Buddha.<br/>
I go not from displeasure, but at this time of increasing excellence,<br/>
I came here to Tibet, have done what was needed and perfected those to be tamed.<br/>
Now the time has come to tame the rÄká¹£asas in the south-west.<br/>
No master save myself has the ability to tame them.<br/>
If I do not do this, they will destroy the Buddhist teachings,<br/>
for they are the very grounds for the unhappiness of beings.<br/>
The time has now come. Only son of mine, be well!<br/>
Do not forget me, but to me forever pray.<br/>
When you have yearning faith, you are worthy of blessing.<br/>
We will not be apart. I will never leave you.â </p>
<p>Mutri Tsenpo was upset, still, and said:<br/>
âI cannot bear the thought of being separated from you.<br/>
Have compassion for us â please, stay in Tibet!<br/>
My father, our great emperor, is no more, has gone to the skies.<br/>
If you, our Guru, do not stay, but leave for the land of rÄká¹£asas,<br/>
Wonât the valleys of Tibet become desolate and empty?<br/>
Are beings no longer the focus of your compassion?<br/>
Do not leave â please, stay in Tibet!â </p>
<p>The Guru replied, âMutri Tsenpo, listen!<br/>
I am the Guru of all beings equally.<br/>
Are you forcing me to abandon bodhicitta?<br/>
If I do not tame the south-western land of rÄká¹£asas,<br/>
all beings will sink into the mires of suffering.<br/>
Then not a word of the sublime Dharma would be heard by anyone.<br/>
Would you wish that to happen?<br/>
I cannot stay, but must be off to tame the rÄká¹£asas.<br/>
For anyone, man or woman, who has faith in me,<br/>
I, the Lotus Born, have never gone away â I sleep at their threshold.<br/>
When the morning light rays shine and the evening light rays fade,<br/>
and also at dawn on the tenth lunar day,<br/>
I will always come for the well-being of Tibet.<br/>
For my future disciples who will not meet me directly,<br/>
they should endeavour in making offerings and paying homage<br/>
to all supports and places of enlightened body, speech, and mind.<br/>
To respect and support the noble Saá¹gha<br/>
is equal to making offerings to Padmasambhava of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.<br/>
My compassion will never fade.<br/>
I will always benefit and protect the people of Tibet.â </p>
<p>The emperor and subjects trusted the Guru, though most of them were tearful.<br/>
No one felt joy; many wept in sorrow.<br/>
The laymen and women of Tibet clustered around<br/>
and touched the MahÄguruâs lotus feet to their crown,<br/>
Offering whatever wealth or possessions they had.<br/>
Prince Mutri Tsenpo, flanked by the empress and ministers,<br/>
offered gold and silver, and gems of all kinds,<br/>
silks soft to touch, and all the luxuries of existence. </p>
<p>Then the Guru spoke: âListen, people of Tibet!<br/>
Like the uá¸umbara flower, the freedoms and advantages are hard to find.<br/>
Like the sun in winter, this human life doesnât last forever.<br/>
There is no end to the sufferings of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
So, practice virtue â and your beneficial qualities will increase.<br/>
The results of this lifeâs activities, good and bad,<br/>
will inevitably ripen later.<br/>
Therefore, without distraction, embrace every thought with the Dharma.<br/>
Place your trust in the authentic guru, and set him above your crown.<br/>
Take refuge, generate bodhicitta, and purify your obscurations<br/>
by means of visualization and recitation.<br/>
Accumulate merit by offering maá¹á¸alas, and practice guru yoga.<br/>
Receive the four empowerments, and mingle your mind as one with the Guruâs.<br/>
Liberated upon arising, beyond the intellectâs reach â<br/>
maintain this vital point!<br/>
Bring to completion the result â the four kÄyas spontaneously present.â<br/>
And so he continued to give many pieces of advice. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the ninth chapter: the Guru Perfects the Benefit of Beings in Tibet, and Sets Out for Other Lands. </p>
<h4>10. The Guruâs Subjugation of the Land of RÄká¹£asas</h4>
<p>As the Guru began his journey to the land of rÄká¹£asas,<br/>
the emperor and subjects went along to wave him off.<br/>
When they reached Mangyulâs upper plain<br/>
the master and his companions rested there for three full days.<br/>
To the emperor and every subject he gave individual pieces of advice.<br/>
Then Khandro YeshÃ© Tsogyal offered a maá¹á¸ala of gold, turquoise, and jewels,<br/>
saying, âKnower of the three times, precious Guru,<br/>
If you are not going to stay in Tibet, but are leaving for the land of rÄká¹£asas,<br/>
do not abandon me, your wife, this woman called Yeshe Tsogyal.<br/>
Do not leave me behind! Please be compassionate!â<br/>
To this, Guru Padma said,<br/>
âThis physical body of yours cannot go to the land of rÄká¹£asas.<br/>
At this time, you must secure the benefit of Tibet.<br/>
Without our ever being parted, I will meet you in the ranks of the VidyÄdharas.â<br/>
Thus, she didnât leave, but stayed to benefit beings.<br/>
With the binding hook mudrÄ, the Guru exclaimed<br/>
âjaá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ baá¹ hoá¸¥ hÅ«á¹ hÅ«á¹ jaá¸¥ hÅ«á¹â.<br/>
They had brought with them a magnificent steed, which they presented to the Guru.<br/>
Then, within swirling rainbow lights, came the words, âI am Princess MandÄravÄ.â<br/>
Carrying a vase of amá¹ta, she now appeared before the Guru<br/>
and dissolved into the khaá¹­vÄá¹ga.<br/>
The Guru, taking the reins of the supreme and precious steed,<br/>
Took to the open skies of the south-west<br/>
with each of the Four Great Kings supporting the horseâs hooves.<br/>
Taking his place there, the Guru disguised himself as the king of rÄká¹£asas.<br/>
He established the whole of the kingdom in the authentic Dharma,<br/>
Spreading far and wide the teachings on bringing benefit to others. </p>
<p>From <em>A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru</em>, this was the tenth chapter: the Guruâs Subjugation of the Land of RÄká¹£asas.</p>
<p><em>I, the Lady Tsogyal, transcribed this life and liberation of the Guru into á¸ÄkinÄ« script and hid it away as a treasure so that beings with the karmic destiny may meet it in the future. As they meet it, may the benefit of beings flourish!</em></p>
<p><em>Samaya!<br/>
Body seal!<br/>
Speech seal!<br/>
Mind seal!</em> </p>
<p><em>This was received by Pema Garwang ChimÃ© Tennyi Lingpa<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> as a siddhi.</em> </p>
<p>The magical display of the enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activities<br/>
of all the buddhas of the three times residing in infinite realms,
endlessly filling the dharmadhÄtu, is the life of the Ocean-Born Vajra.
It defies imagination.<br/>
However, as an entryway for fortune disciples,<br/>
what is given here is a simple, straightforward, and accessible
Vajra testament â in just a few words.
Thanks to the kindness of Lotsawa JamgÃ¶n, we encountered them.<br/>
Let us dedicate the merit of spreading this publication in manifold ways<br/>
accumulated through Lama SÃ¶nam Tsetenâs pure motivation<br/>
So that all beings, especially our mother and father, may be reborn in the Guruâs presence. </p>
<p><em>These words of aspiration were written by Khyentse Tulku for the publication of this text.</em></p>

<p>The Tibetan word <em>mtsho</em> is used to refer to any large body of water. This led to the idea that Padmasambhava took birth on a lake. However, some masters, such as Kyabje Chatral Rinpoche, have suggested that <em>mtsho</em>, in the case of Padmasambhavaâs birth place, refers to the Arabian Sea. More specifically, they suggest as Padmasambhavaâs birth place the area where the Sindhu (Indus) river meets the Arabian Sea in the ancient Sindh Kingdom, near the border between modern Pakistan and India. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
