<p>The sÄdhanas and activity liturgies of Siá¹hamukhÄ appear in The Precept of the Net of Tantras<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> and bring together an ocean of oral instructions.</p>
<h4>The History</h4>
<p>The great lotsawa Baripa<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> of Dring Tsam<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> went to India in order to listen to, study, practice and translate the sÅ«tras and tantras written in Indic languages. </p>
<p>Afterwards he travelled to Nepal, where he received teachings from Chiterwa the Newar,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> and trained and conversed with him. During his stay in Nepal, Baripa engaged in dialogue and debate with the heretic teacher BhavyarÄja.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> Day after day, BhavyarÄja would defeat the lotsawa and win the debate. Despondent, finally one evening the lotsawa invoked his gurus, iá¹£á¹­adevatÄs and especially Acala<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> and prayed to them for help. </p>
<p>The next morning the lotsawa triumphed in the debate, with the heretic Bhavya experiencing a devastating loss. Bhavya became furious, and warned Master Baripa, saying, âYouâve slipped into a bad habit! Now I will cast spells upon you. You will either be left defeated and humiliated in no more than seven days, or you will be forced by the power of my black magic to accept my teachings!â </p>
<p>The lotsawa was overwhelmed with fear and rushed back to the great scholar Chiterwa. In a trembling voice, Baripa recounted the debate with the heretic BhavyarÄja, saying, âAs soon as I won, Bhavya became enraged and told me that he is going to cast evil spells which will destroy me within seven days! And if this is not the case, then the spells will force me to accept his teaching. What should I do?â </p>
<p>The great Newar scholar Chiterwa replied, âO lotsawa! Do not be afraid! It seems you would rather kill yourself than accept this hereticâs doctrine. Now, I will have to send you to India to train in averting the dark arts of life-taking evil spells with the great guru of VajrÄsana.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> Here, take from this box the powder of swift-footedness and rub it on your feet.â </p>
<p>So Baripa rubbed the powder on his feet, and he reached the Nepali lowlands that very same morning. After merely a half-dayâs travel, Baripa arrived at the Vajra Throne.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> </p>
<p>Baripa then met with the great guru VajrÄsana and presented his letter of introduction from the learned Chiterwa. He also offered one <em>sho</em><a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> of gold as a gift to VajrÄsana and related the story of his debate with the heretic teacher in great detail. </p>
<p>Guru MahÄvajrÄsana replied, âO lotsawa! Do not be afraid of the heretic teacher! I have a variety of pith instructions for protection and reversal; one in particular is exceptionally profound and acute. In order to retrieve it, first you must prepare an excellent torma<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> of flesh and blood on the evening of the tenth day of the month.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> While offering it, one-pointedly invoke and pray to the assembly of the Three Jewels and your gurus, iá¹£á¹­adevatÄs and á¸ÄkinÄ«s. Then at dawn you will receive a prophecy from the á¸ÄkinÄ«s.â </p>
<p>So the lotsawa prepared a <em>gaá¹acakra</em><a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> using four <em>sang</em><a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> of gold and undertook the invocation. The gurus, iá¹£á¹­adevatÄs and á¸ÄkinÄ«s paid heed and as a result granted him the following prophecy, proclaiming, âO lotsawa! Do not be afraid of the heretic! We will grant you protection!â </p>
<p>The principle á¸ÄkinÄ« of this assembly was the esteemed wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ« Siá¹hamukhÄ, who counselled him, saying, âThe supreme among all pith instructions, combining the red, black and mottled<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> like an ocean of amá¹ta which annihilates all, lies hidden about one <em>kroÅa</em><a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> to the south of the Vajra Throne. Search there for an iron boulder that looks like a dead yak. Beneath it you will find black earth in the shape of a triangle. If you dig there you will find a small sealed chest covered by charcoal. Inside of this there is a rhinoceros leather chest. Inside of this there is a chest made of the bodhi-tree wood. This chest contains a silver chest. Within the silver chest is a precious chest of gold. Within the gold chest is a turquoise chest. Inside the turquoise chest is a lapis-lazuli chest. Within this is a ruby chest, within which, wrapped in maroon-coloured silk and human skin, you will find âthe fourteen-syllable fierce averting mantraâ,<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> written with the heart-blood of all á¸ÄkinÄ«s; it does not begin with oá¹, and it does not end with svÄhÄ. It is ornamented by neither iâs nor uâs, neither oâs nor eâs. It is written without spaces between the syllables in one single continuous line. Once you have uncovered it, recite it every day twenty-one times, and you will be protected from all evil spells; you will avert all that is harmful, pacify all adversities and obstacles, and all siddhis and all that is favourable will come to you. If you recite it twenty-one times in the morning and strong disturbing negative thoughts arise, do not recite it any more!â </p>
<p>With those words, Siá¹hamukhÄ vanished without a trace, like a rainbow into thin air. </p>
<p>So the lotsawa left before the break of dawn, carrying with him a large red torma as an offering. Soon he reached a yak-shaped boulder. As instructed, he dug where he found triangular-shaped black earth, and first came forth the charcoal. </p>
<p>Then, as the prophecy foretold, he took out the chests, and so he revealed the life-force mantra of all the á¸ÄkinÄ«s, the pith-instruction which is like an ocean of amá¹ta. In exchange for the treasure, the lotsawa placed a precious golden text in the chest and then hid it again just as he had found it. </p>
<p>The lotsawa then recited the mantra according to the pith instruction, day and night without interruption. </p>
<p>One day, at dusk, signs arose that the heretic had targeted the lotsawa with black magic, yet all the worldly á¸ÄkinÄ«s and dharmapÄlas<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> sent by the heretic were unable to harm the lotsawa, so they became ashamed and left. Thus the lotsawa was able to avert the threat. </p>
<p>After the sun had set, the lotsawa managed to avert the cloud of worldly deities and spirits that had gathered. At dawn, the lotsawa was able to avert the cloud of activity á¸ÄkinÄ«s. </p>
<p>Then the esteemed and foremost wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ« Siá¹hamukhÄ appeared once again in the sky before the lotsawa and spoke, âO Baripa, the heretic teacher BhavyarÄja has vomited blood and lives no more!â </p>
<p>Overjoyed, Bari Lotsawa returned to Guru VajrÄsana and shared this news. Guru VajrÄsana replied, âIn these degenerate times, fearful sentient beings employ their negative emotions to win arguments. I am one such master,â he lamented, covering his head in disappointment.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> Moved, Bari Lotsawa prostrated many times before his Guru and confessed, âO Guru! Not only have I averted this evil out of fear, I have also engaged in spells that caused the death of my opponent. So now I must bear the fault of having taken the life of another!â </p>
<p>The great VajrÄsana replied, âIt would have sufficed merely to wear the mantra I have spoken of on your body, but you have recited the mantra day and night without interruption! Thus you have accumulated the fault of killing. Now you must exert yourself in purifying this bad deed. Do not return to me until definite signs arise that it has been purified.â </p>
<p>For one whole year, then, the lotsawa exerted himself in purifying this evil, during which time he did not have a single opportunity to meet his guru, the great VajrÄsana. The close disciples of VajrÄsana, without any signs of pride, treated Baripa with great kindness, bringing him food and liquor<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> when possible, along with anything else he needed, all without the guruâs knowing. When signs finally arose that Baripa had purified his evil deeds, and his guruâs command, his wish, had been accomplished and fulfilled, he was once again able to meet his guru.</p>
<p>From then onwards, Baripa requested many teachings and became both learned and faithful. When he returned to Tibet, he benefited beings on a vast scale. Later still, he journeyed to the glorious Sakya monastery<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> and transmitted the pith instructions and related empowerments, sÄdhanas and activity liturgies to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a></p>
<p>The instructions on Siá¹hamukhÄ were then transmitted to the precious teacher JetsÃ¼n Drakpa Gyaltsen,<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> the great Sakya Paá¹á¸ita,<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> the great JetsÃ¼n Phakpa,<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> Nyene Rongpo Dorje,<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> Rongpo Sangye Yeshe,<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> and the precious teacher of Rongpo, the learned Yakde Paá¹chen.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a> </p>
<p>Thus the uncommon practice of the wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ« Siá¹hamukhÄ was established. This led many to gain visionary experiences of the deity, while the practice itself brought a constant rain of blessings. </p>
<p>The heart-essence mantra also reached the accomplished lady JetsÃ¼nma Timudra;<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> the eminent scholar, the precious Samten Pal Zangpo;<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> the Mantra-holder of the degenerate time, the great Vajradhara, the realized Namkha Sangye GÃ¶npo;<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a> Rechen Kunga Darpo,<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a> the heart-son Kunga Zangpo;<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> and finally the learned and accomplished master, the kind teacher, speech of infinite teachings, Champa ChÃ¶kyi Nyima.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> </p>
<h4>The History of the Special Lineage of the Uncommon Pith-Instructions</h4>
<p>The realized Namkha Sangye GÃ¶npo took birth in an area that belonged to the great and glorious Dharma centre of Ne Nying.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> As he grew up, he joined Ne Nying where he listened, studied, and applied himself well. Then one day he fell ill with acute leprosy and experienced great hardship and fatigue. </p>
<p>One of his close vajra-brothers told him, âWhen such intense hardships befall you, practice Siá¹hamukhÄ, for it is said to help. Heeding his friendâs advice for recovery, Sangye GÃ¶npo then requested and received the transmission from Khenpo Denpa.<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a> When he returned to Ne Nying, Sangye GÃ¶npo thought to himself, âIf I apply myself in the recitation of this fourteen-syllable mantra, I will surely get better.â </p>
<p>However, his disease only worsened, and so Sangye GÃ¶npo considered the situation. He thought, âI stay in this Dharma centre, but despite this I am not getting any better. What is the point, then, of remaining here any longer? Iâll leave, and even though my body is not well, at least my mind is carefree and at ease. That way if my body fails, no one has to worry over me.â </p>
<p>He gave all his possessions to his vajra-brothers and sisters and set off in the direction of Shang Zambu.<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> There, in the mountains of Zambu, he dedicated himself without concern for life or death to the recitation of Siá¹hamukhÄ. Yet still his leprosy did not improve, and eventually his retreat supplies ran out. </p>
<p>When Sangye GÃ¶npo experienced this terrible hardship, one night, in a dream, an unusually well-turned out girl appeared. She spoke to him and said, âIf you remain here your leprosy will not heal. Leave, and go quickly to the valley of Takna.<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> There great siddhis await you!â </p>
<p>With these words, the girl vanished in the air like a rainbow. Sangye GÃ¶npo awoke and reflected upon what he had witnessed in his dream, wondering, âWill my disease really be healed? Either way, I will go in search of Takna.â </p>
<p>So Sangye GÃ¶npo left, walking down from his place of meditation. He asked everyone he met along the way where Takna was, but there was not a single person who knew its location. </p>
<p>One evening when he became tired, he lay down to sleep in an alleyway. Once the burning, stabbing pain had subsided slightly, providing some comfort, he fell asleep. In his dreams, the girl appeared once again, with the words, âTomorrow your search for Takna will end.â And then, she vanished. </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo awoke and thought to himself, âWhat kind of siddhis will I receive if I find Takna tomorrow? If I meet a healer who can help me, that would be my siddhi. But I doubt I would meet someone like that. Three Jewels, look upon me with compassion!â </p>
<p>As he began to cry, a young girl holding a bowl full of soup and pastries approached, stopping in front of Sangye GÃ¶npo. âEat this. It [will ease] the misery of your sickness. Where are you from?â she asked, offering Sangye GÃ¶npo some food. </p>
<p>âI came from Ne Nying,â Sangye GÃ¶npo replied and told the girl his story in great detail. âSo now I am searching for Takna.â </p>
<p>âTraveller, have you not yet found Takna?â the young girl asked. </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo replied: âNo, I havenât found Takna. I have been staying here out of exhaustion.â </p>
<p>âDonât you know?â the girl asked with a laugh. âTraveller, you keep searching for Takna, but youâre already here!â </p>
<p>With another laugh the young girl continued on her way. </p>
<p>So Sangye GÃ¶npo, the kind teacher, again took up the practice of Siá¹hamukhÄ. Though his leprosy did not heal, he felt at ease. </p>
<p>One night, though, when he became saddened, the girl from before appeared again in his dreams. She said, âOn this, the upper side of the valley, there is a northern facing cave. Go there and you will receive the siddhis,â and then vanished like a rainbow into the air. </p>
<p>The kind teacher proceeded to ask the locals about the cave. âWe didnât know there was a cave there. You should search for it,â they replied. </p>
<p>As this kind teacher encountered no one who knew anything about the cave, he went to search for it himself, but still couldnât find it. </p>
<p>The girl who gave him food the night before appeared again, and said, âTraveller, since your body is not well you cannot rest.â </p>
<p>âIâll say! You told me that there is a northern facing cave around here, and I went looking for it,â he replied. </p>
<p>âIt is up there!â she scolded, showing her anger, which made Sangye GÃ¶npoâs body freeze and disturbed his mind. </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo then went to stay in the cave, and practiced there. The pain of his disease became so strong that he was on the verge of falling unconscious. </p>
<p>Just before midnight, a bright light appeared, and he heard terribly loud stomping noises. The five families of Siá¹hamukhÄs together with retinues of hundreds of thousands had appeared in actuality within his cave! In an instant they began to partake of Sangye GÃ¶npoâs aggregates of flesh and blood as an elaborate feast. Sangye GÃ¶npo fainted in that very moment. </p>
<p>When he finally came to his senses, he found that all the pus and blood and wounds on his body were completely removed without even a trace remaining, while pus and blood covered his seat and the entire cave. Fully recovered from his ailment, Sangye GÃ¶npo finally found physical and mental ease. </p>
<p>The five classes of Siá¹hamukhÄs then granted Sangye GÃ¶npo all the outer, inner and secret empowerments, the sÄdhanas and activity liturgies in their entirety, and then actually dissolved into the cave itself. </p>
<p>It was thus that the precious, the realized, the great lord of yogins, Repa Namkha Sangye GÃ¶npo was healed from his disease, and was thereafter accompanied by Siá¹hamukhÄ wherever he went. </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo continued to feel blissful, and when the auspicious time had come for his heart disciple, the noble and supreme, great Repa Kunga Darpo to take hold of his lineage, Sangye GÃ¶npo travelled to Shang Sanglung.<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> </p>
<p>Once there, Sangye GÃ¶npo asked if a yogin resided at the monastery. One person replied, âExcept for that crazy yogin who acts inappropriately towards the nuns, there hasnât been a dharma practitioner residing at length.â </p>
<p>The kind teacher thought to himself, âI wonder whether this is the yogin who will become my lineage holder.â </p>
<p>After invoking and praying to the á¸ÄkinÄ« for only a short while, a black person appeared. âWhat do you need?â he said. </p>
<p>The precious teacher replied, âI have a goal I aim to accomplish here.â </p>
<p>The black person replied, âWhat brings you here? Except for the great Repa, the lord of the yogins, Kunga Darpo, nobody resides here. If you have a message for him, I will deliver it.â </p>
<p>The kind lama replied, âPlease tell him that a pith instruction awaits him.â </p>
<p>The black person went in, and immediately Repa Kunga Darpo stepped outside. The moment the lamas met they felt that they had been connected as teacher and student in their past [lives]. Kunga Darpo prostrated before Sangye GÃ¶npo and put his feet on his head. </p>
<p>Then, with devotion he made a request, âPlease be so kind and bestow your pith-instructions upon me. Last night I had a very auspicious dream...â </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo replied, âPlease share your dream without leaving out any details.â </p>
<p>âLast night in my dream, a very beautiful girl with her hair tied in a top knot appeared. She was holding a kÄ«la that bore the face of Siá¹hamukhÄ and a kÄpÄla filled with amá¹ta. She handed me both and laughed. Then I woke up feeling delighted and happy.â </p>
<p>The two lamas went inside where they offered a gaá¹acakra. Kunga Darpo then asked, âPlease kindly bestow your pith-instructions in their entirety to me, without leaving anything aside.â </p>
<p>Sangye GÃ¶npo replied, âI will give everything to you. Tonight is an auspicious time, for it is the twenty-fifth day (the á¸ÄkinÄ« day). If I give you the transmissions tonight it will be extremely auspicious. Following an excellent gaá¹acakra and a gold maá¹á¸ala offering, I will first perform the sÄdhana and then perform the self-initiation.â </p>
<p>So that evening Sangye GÃ¶npo gave the outer empowerment, at midnight the inner empowerment, and, finally, in the early morning the secret empowerment. </p>
<p>When the transmissions had finished Sangye GÃ¶npo folded his hands before his head and said, âNow Iâve granted you the empowerments, sÄdhanas, pith-instructions, clarification and activity liturgies of the á¸ÄkinÄ«. This is a treasure that needs to be kept secret. Now, you should follow my instructions with perseverance and engage in authentic practice to delight the á¸ÄkinÄ«.â </p>
<p>The two lamas had formed a heart connection and exchanged many oral instructions. Sangye GÃ¶npo warned, âThese instructions should not be bestowed upon more than one lineage holder at a time. The seal of secrecy has to be firm and the practice commitment maintained.â </p>
<p>Then the precious teacher meditated upon the teachings in the south, and the great Repa Kunga Darpo dedicated himself to the sÄdhana practice completely. </p>
<p>The lineage of the outer empowerments were then transmitted to the lord of yogins, the heart-disciple Kunga Zangpo, who in turn transmitted it to my teacher ChÃ¶kyi Nyima. </p>
<h4>The Uncommon Lineage</h4>
<p>The uncommon lineage of the inner and secret empowerments and activity liturgies of the white, black and varied, is:<br/>
DharmakÄya Samantabhadra in union,<br/>
The wisdom á¸ÄkinÄ« Simá¸¥amukhÄ,<br/>
The unequalled Guru of Uá¸á¸iyÄna in union,<br/>
The realized Namkha Sangye GÃ¶npo,<br/>
The destroyer of illusion, the great Repa Kunga Darpo,<br/>
The Mantra-holder TsÃ¶ndru Senge,<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a><br/>
From whom my root teacher ChÃ¶kyi Nyima received the teachings on Siá¹hamukhÄ. </p>
<p><em>This concludes the history of the lineage of Siá¹hamukhÄ that inspires faith.</em></p>

<p>In the following historical narrative Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo recounts the origin of the teachings of Siá¹hamukhÄ and how they have been subsequently passed down to him. In his account Jamyang Khyentse closely follows the famous story of their origin as found in the teachings connected to the lineage of Bari Lotsawa (<em>ba ri lugs</em>). The following narrative was extracted from a cycle of pith-instructions following Bari Lotsawaâs lineage written by Jamyang Khyentse and entitled âThe Excellent Vase of Precious Jewels: Selected Pith-Instructions on the History, SÄdhana and Activity Liturgies of the Hearing Lineage of the Profound and Secret Practice of Siá¹hamukhÄ, The Bodong Tradition of the Accomplished Sangye GÃ¶npoâ (<em>zab gsang seng gdong snyan brgyud kyi lo rgyus sgrub thabs las tshogs dang bcas pa'i man ngag gi yi ge gces btus rin chen bum bzang zhes bya ba bzhugs so/ grub chen sangs rgyas mgon po nas brgyud pa'i bo dong lugs</em>). <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Bari lotsawa (<em>ba ri lo tsA ba</em>, 1040-1111) was born in Kham in 1040. He spent nine years (1073-1082) studying in India with various teachers and returned to Tibet in 1082. During these years Bari Lotsawa studied with several Indian teachers, including many who supported him in his translation. Upon his return to Tibet, Bari Lotsawa headed Sakya monastery (<em>Sa skya dgon pa</em>) for a period of ten years following the death of KhÃ¶n KÃ¶nchok Gyalpo (<em>Khon dkon mchog rgyal po</em>, 1034-1102) in 1102. He also acted as the tutor and teacher of KhÃ¶n KÃ¶nchok Gyalpoâs son Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (<em>Sa chen Kun dgaâ snying po</em>, 1092-1158). <a href="#fnref:5" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Chiterwa (<em>spyi ther ba</em>) was a student of NÄropa (956-1040) and also one of Marpa Lotsawaâs (1012-1097) main teachers. While there appears to be no independent biography of Chiterwa, he is frequently mentioned within Marpa Lotsawaâs biography. Thus for their interaction, see: Tsang NyÃ¶n Heruka, <em>The Life of Marpa the Translator</em>, transl. by the Nalanda Translation Committee, (Boulder: PrajÃ±Ä Press, 1982), xxvii, 10-11, 39, 107, 111, 202. <a href="#fnref:7" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Bari Lotsawa studied with Amoghavajra (<em>don yod rdo rje</em>), a great tenth century Indian paá¹á¸ita, who received the title VajrÄsana (<em>rdo rje gdan pa</em>), âthe guru of VajrÄsanaâ, because he was the abbot of VajrÄsana, the Vajra Throne, in modern day Bodh Gaya in India. On invitation of Bari and other Tibetan lotsawas Amoghavajra is said to have travelled to and taught in Tibet. Amoghavajraâs teacher was likewise an abbot of VajrÄsana and is thus also referred to as VajrÄsana. Both teachers worked closely together with Tibetan lotsawas. In Tibetan the two teachers bearing the same name are often distinguished by referring to them as VajrÄsana the greater (<em>rdo rje gdan pa chen po</em>) and VajrÄsana the younger (<em>rdo rje gdan pa chung po</em>). Generally it is stated that Bari Lotsawa studied with Amoghavajra that is VajrÄsana the younger. However, in this text Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo continuously calls Baripaâs teacher VajrÄsana the greater (<em>rdo rje gdan pa chen po</em>). Thus, it may be the case that Bari Lotsawa studied with both teachers, or that Jamyang Khyentse used the adjective âgreatâ (<em>chen po</em>) to honour VajrÄsana. In order to account for this ambiguity, we have rendered Bari Lotsawaâs teacherâs name as âthe great guru of VajrÄsanaâ (<em>bla ma rdo rje gdan pa chen po</em>). <a href="#fnref:10" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
