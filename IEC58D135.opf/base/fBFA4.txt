And may the guru’s blessings infuse my mindstream.

May I eradicate the basis of delusion in my three doors of body, speech and mind,
kadak rangnang rimé ngön du gyur
May I actualise the primordial purity, which is self-appearing and without bias,
lhündrub nang zhi zé sar khyol né kyang
And having reached the exhaustion of the four visions of spontaneous perfection,
zhönnu bumkü ying su changchub shok
May I awaken in the sphere of the youthful vase body.

zakpa rang zé jungwa rang sar deng
With defilements naturally dissipated, elements naturally disappeared,
drenpa rangdrol zangtal ö kyi lü
And consciousness naturally liberated, in an unobstructed body of light,
sengé wangchuk nyi dang nyam gyur né
May I become the equal of Sengé Wangchuk himself,
drolwa nam zhi khorwa dong truk shok
And through the four modes of liberation empty saṃsāra from its depths.

Lodrö Thayé composed this in a remote location. May virtue and excellence increase.
